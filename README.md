# Bagel-V2
**Update**: Since I released an [improved version of the service worker plugin this originally used](https://github.com/hedgehog125/SvelteKit-Adapter-Versioned-Worker), this PWA adapted to use it from the older version.

I made a sequel to the original Bagel PWA to see how quickly I could make it.

This uses SvelteKit and my plugin [SvelteKit-Plugin-Versioned-Worker](https://github.com/hedgehog125/SvelteKit-Plugin-Versioned-Worker).
